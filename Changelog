Changes 0.5 - 0.6

  * More efficient representation of Storable vectors

  * Block copy operations used when possible

  * Typeable and Data instances

  * Monadic combinators (replicateM, mapM etc.)

  * Better support for recycling (see create and modify)

  * Performance improvements

Changes 0.4.2 - 0.5

  * Unboxed vectors of primitive types and tuples.

  * Redesigned interface between mutable and immutable vectors. It now
  includes the popular unsafeFreeze primitive.

  * Many new combinators.

  * Significant performance improvements. Unboxed vectors are usually faster
  than primitive unboxed DPH arrays.
